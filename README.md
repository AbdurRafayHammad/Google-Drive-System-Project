Google Drive File System
The Google Drive File System is a console-based application that simulates a powerful cloud storage platform. Built in C++, this system uses core data structures and OOP principles to deliver functionalities like file versioning, compression, user authentication, and file sharing — all within a terminal interface.

Introduction
This project aims to replicate essential features of cloud storage systems (like Google Drive) using efficient C++ data structures. It emphasizes optimized storage, secure user management, version tracking, and real-time file operations, providing a robust backend for virtual file handling.

Data Structures Used
Tree — Folder Structure
Hierarchical directory structure using a tree, supporting both depth-first and breadth-first traversal.

Hash Table — File Metadata Lookup
File metadata (size, type, date, owner) is stored in a hash table for O(1) search, insertion, and update.

Stack — Recycle Bin
Implements LIFO strategy for deleted files, allowing efficient recovery of the most recently deleted items.

Queue — Recent Files (LRU)
Maintains recently accessed files in a FIFO order to simulate Least Recently Used (LRU) caching behavior.

Graph — User Authentication & File Sharing
A graph tracks users as nodes and file-sharing relationships as directed edges, enabling BFS/DFS traversal for access control and sharing.

Doubly Linked List — Version History
Each file maintains its version history in a doubly linked list, supporting rollback and update tracking.

Functionalities by Level
2.1 Basic Functionalities
Folder/File Management
Create, navigate, delete folders and files using tree + hash table.

File CRUD Operations
Create, Read, Update (store version), and Delete (send to Recycle Bin).

Recycle Bin
Stack-based mechanism to recover most recently deleted files. Includes time-based auto-deletion.

Recent Files
Queue-based access tracking system for fast retrieval of most-used files.

User Authentication
Sign up, login, logout with time stamps. Supports password recovery via security questions.

2.2 Intermediate Functionalities
File Search
Combines tree traversal with hash-based lookup.

Graph-based File Sharing
Share files among users using directed edges. Visualize access via BFS/DFS traversal.

File Versioning
Add/rollback versions of a file using doubly linked list for tracking changes.

Robust Error Handling
Input validation, duplication checks, access rights, and exceptions for safe operations.

2.3 Advanced Functionalities
Access Control & Permissions
Role-based access (Admin, Editor, Viewer) with:
Admin: Full control (read/write/execute)
Editor: Read and Write
Viewer: Read-only
Directed edges define permission levels.

Compression Algorithms
Run-Length Encoding (RLE): AAAAABBBCC → 5A3B2C
Dictionary Compression: Replaces repeated words with codes

Cloud Sync Queue
Background sync using queue mechanism to simulate cloud storage syncing.

Scalability & Optimization
Uses balanced trees like AVL (planned)
Simulates garbage collection to manage memory

Requirements
C++ Compiler (g++, MSVC, MinGW)
Console terminal (Windows or Linux)
No third-party libraries required

Concepts Demonstrated
OOP: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism
File I/O: fstream for user persistence and metadata
Data Structures: Stack, Queue, Linked List, Hash Table, Tree, Graph
Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Hashing, Compression (RLE/Dictionary)
Role-based Access Control
CLI UX: Color-coded output, loading animation, prompts

About
Developed as a term project for the Data Structures & Algorithms course, this simulation demonstrates how complex systems like cloud file storage can be built using simple yet powerful core data structures. It serves as a great learning resource for understanding how theoretical structures apply to real-world problems.
